# Welcome to the ADAM Platform Wiki

**Autonomous Discovery and Advanced Manufacturing (ADAM)** is an AI orchestrator that controls physical hardware (Desktop Metal binder jetting printers) to run autonomous materials experiments in closed loops.

This wiki is designed to help developers understand the platform's architecture, backend services, and integration with the INTERSECT backbone.

## Table of Contents

### Core Concepts
- **[Architecture Overview](Architecture-Overview.md)**: High-level system design, frontend/backend split, and data flow.
- **[Backend Services](Backend-Services.md)**: Deep dive into the Nova Orchestrator, API Gateway, and infrastructure components.

### Integration
- **[INTERSECT Integration](INTERSECT-Integration.md)**: How ADAM connects to lab hardware using ORNL's INTERSECT architecture, including contracts and schema mapping.

### Getting Started
- **[Developer Setup](Developer-Setup.md)**: Guide to setting up your local development environment, running services, and debugging.
